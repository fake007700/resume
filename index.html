            </h3>
            <p>
                <b>Guide: </b>Dr. Vinayak Abrol <br />
                Build a Machine Learning model that when fed with an image (containing a single character
                (integer or alphabet or a special character)) gives us the character which is drawn in the
                image. We used the latest <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/preatcher/standard-ocr-dataset">kaggle dataset</a> 
                to train our model. We read many research papers and tried out various Machine Learning models like <b>Random Forest, KNN, GMM, SVM</b>
                to get the best prediction.<br />

            </h3>
            <p>
                <b>Guide: </b>Dr. Mukesh Mohania <br />
                Used <b>Python, MySQL</b> and the concepts of Database Management Systems like <b>Views,
                grants, triggers, indexing, relational schema, ER diagram</b> to build an interactive
                command line application that manages the retail store data along with shipping and delivery
                management. The database had more than 300 users (customer, supplier, manufacturer) and
                many products.<br />

                Peer to many peer file copy program using IPC
                [<a href = "https://github.com/premkjain/Inter-Process-Communication-IPC">Repository</a>]
            </h3>
            <p>
                <b>Guide: </b>Dr. Sambuddho Chakravarty <br />
                Designed a file copying system using Inter-Process Communication (IPC) with two mecha-
                nisms using C language. The first uses domain sockets (AF UNIX) where the sender estab-
                lishes a listening socket, accepts client connections, and forks child processes to serve each
                client, transmitting the file byte by byte using write(). The second part employs shared mem-
                ory, where the sender populates a shared memory region with file content, and receiver peers
                read from it simultaneously, using semaphores to prevent race conditions.<br />

            <p>
                <b>Guide: </b>Dr. Sujay Deb <br />
                Used <b>Python, Matplotlib</b> and the concepts of computer organization to build an <b>assembler</b>
                for simple instruction set architecture that is similar to the ARM assembly language and then
                created a <b>simulator</b> for the same assembler and tested it using automated testing through
